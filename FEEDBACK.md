Great question! Both approaches are helpful, but in different ways:

"Well done" or simple acknowledgment is totally fine and appreciated when:

The work matches your expectations
You want to signal approval to continue
Specific feedback is more valuable when:

Something particularly impressed you (helps me understand your preferences)
You'd like certain patterns repeated in future work
You want to calibrate my approach (e.g., "I liked the detailed profiling table, do that for future comparisons")
Most useful feedback patterns:

Highlight what worked: "The benchmark comparison table was exactly what I needed"
Note preferences: "I prefer when you close beads issues with detailed reasons like you did"
Correct course early: "This is good, but next time skip X and focus more on Y"
For this workflow, I'd add that approving artifacts with "LGTM" (like you did) is a very efficient way to signal approval - it lets auto-proceed kick in so we keep momentum.

Ready to proceed with Phase 1 (BCBC PDF processing verification)?
